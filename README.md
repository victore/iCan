The demo application will present users with a list of projects, both ongoing and finished. Users with different roles will have different level of access:

* Guests: won’t have any access to the projects. They will only see the main page of the site.
* Users: will be able to see only the ongoing projects. They won’t be able to modify or delete anything.
* Moderators: will have access to all projects with the ability to edit the ongoing ones.
* Admins: will have full access.
